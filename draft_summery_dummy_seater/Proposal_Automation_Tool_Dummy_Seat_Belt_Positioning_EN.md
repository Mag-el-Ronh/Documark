# 🧠 Proposal: Automation Tool for Dummy, Seat & Belt Positioning

## 🎯 Objective

To introduce a modular automation tool that streamlines the setup of dummy, seat, and belt systems for **occupant-based crash simulations**. The tool reduces engineering cost, simplifies workflow, and ensures reproducibility—while maintaining flexibility for manual intervention or integration with other tools.

---

## 🔍 Background

Occupant-based crash simulation setup typically involves three distinct steps:

1. **Dummy Positioning**  
2. **Seat Deformation & Preloading**  
3. **Seatbelt Generation & Routing**

These steps are often executed manually using multiple software platforms (e.g., VE, ANSA, ProDSiG), requiring expert knowledge and significant time investment. The lack of integration leads to inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and increased cost.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

A unified automation tool with **three independent modules**, each designed to perform a specific setup task. Users can run modules individually or in combination, and retain the option to use external tools for any step.

> ⚠️ **Key Advantage**  
> This tool provides a viable alternative to traditionally combined workflows involving multiple commercial tools. In many cases, it **fully replaces** expensive software such as **ProDSiG** and **Belt-Module**, offering equivalent or superior functionality at a fraction of the cost.

### 🧍 Module 1: Dummy Positioning Automation

- Automatically positions the dummy based on predefined orientation, posture, and surrounding geometry.
- Enforces anthropometric rules and regulatory alignment (e.g., Euro NCAP).
- Compatible with VE/ANSA and supports structured position files.
- **Flexible**: Users can override or manually adjust dummy pose.

### 🪑 Module 2: Seat Preloading Setup

- Sets up a solver-specific deck (LS-DYNA, PamCrash) to simulate gravity-based dummy settling.
- Captures realistic seat deformation and preload state.
- Automates contact definitions and boundary conditions.
- **Flexible**: Preload simulation can be skipped or run externally.

### 🔗 Module 3: Belt Modeling & Routing

- Automatically generates and routes seatbelt geometry over the dummy and seat.
- Applies initial tension (e.g., 20–50 N) and defines contact/friction behavior.
- Solver-specific setup ensures compatibility and accuracy.
- **Flexible**: Belt routing can be customized or imported from other tools.

## ⚙️ Integration & Compatibility

- Supports major solvers: **LS-DYNA**, **PamCrash**
- Interfaces with existing tools: **VE**, **ANSA**, **ProDSiG**
- Modular architecture allows selective use of automation or manual override
